# slb_websocket_server
A light-weight, performant websocket server supporting N-many
subscribable message channels based on unique, client provided, subscription keys.

slb_websocket_server was designed to intergrate into the rest of the
super-limit-break live performance tool-chain, but is generic enough to be
useful as a stand-alone websocket messaging system.
